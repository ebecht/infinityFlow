#Infinity Flow: High-throughput single-cell quantification of 100s of proteins using conventional flow cytometry and machine learning

This repository contains the software package ***infinityFlow*** designed to analyze massively-parallel cytometry experiments, such as BioLegend's *LEGENDScreen* or's BD *Cell surface screening panels*.
